# Next-star

This is a pet project to create an iOS OSS client for the [Nextcloud Bookmarks app](https://apps.nextcloud.com/apps/bookmarks).

As such, the quality of the Swift code in here is definitely not at the standard of a production-grade iOS app since I just started learning iOS development with Swift / SwiftUI with this project.

If you're looking for a more feature-complete and robust project, check the official Github repository of the Bookmarks app for the [recommended iOS clients](https://github.com/nextcloud/bookmarks#ios).

This is part of my efforts to maintain as many of the data points that I generate on my self-hosted services and generally be in control of my data. It's likely that a blogpost on [my blog](https://jay.cat) will follow explaining how to set up stuff in order to be able to host your own instance and run the app on your iOS device.
